## Purpose

The Disabled in Tech Slack account exists to create a supportive community of people who work in tech or in adjacent fields who have one or more disabilities. The following rules and Code of Conduct are focused on insuring that our community is a safe, helpful place.

## General Rules:

*Avoid language that can be offensive or hurtful. 
*Only post the same message in up to 2 channels at a time. There will be a lot of crossover in channel membership.
*Use @here sparingly. This sends a notification to everyone online in that channel.
*We will not be allowing animated emojis to avoid any issues they can cause, please use gifs sparingly.
*Keep messages on topic for the channel you are in. If someone asks you to move an off-topic conversation, please do so. Note that you can always leave a public channel and come back to it later if an on-topic conversation ever gets to be too much for you.


## Code of Conduct:

As this Slack is to create a supportive community, all members are expected to respect each other and the disabilities we may face. The Slack should remain a welcoming place for all disabled people, regardless of gender, race, location, age, religions, skill level, or anything else.

### Zero Tolerance for Harassment 

This slack has a _zero tolerance policy_ when it comes to harassment. 

This includes, but is not limited to, personal attacks, bullying, stalking, intimidation, creating an unwelcoming environment, posting pictures of a graphic sexual nature, and unwelcome sexual attention.

This extends to any harassment by a member to another member that comes to our attention, whether it happens on our Slack, other social media, or in person.

## Violations and Rule Breaking

### Reporting Violations:

If a member feels, for any reason, that they are experiencing harassment, please report it. Your identity will be kept anonymous among the mods in charge of dealing with such things.

_Please DM a mod with any violations_. A list of mods will be kept pinned in #announcements once there are enough to warrant it. They will make every effort to stay impartial when dealing with rule/CoC violations.

Please include the username of the person being reported, a description of what has happened, and links to any relevant messages (if in a public channel).

Anonymous reporting will be setup, but note that anonymous reporting will mean that you will not receive any sort of reply from the mods and that if further details are required they will have no way of receiving them.

### Breaking the Rules:

Breaking the general rules will result in, depending on the nature of the violation, a comment in the channel or a direct message from a mod. More actions may be taken for repeat offenders.

### CoC Violations:

We have a 3-strike policy for CoC violations.

1) The first violation will result in a warning, which will include reasoning as to why the offense is viewed as a CoC violation, a chance to explain the violation, and advice on how to avoid similar violations in the future. This will take place over DM or, if the member does not respond within 2 days, through email.

2) The second violation will consist of a temporary suspension. The member will be notified by email of the violation and suspension. 

3) The third violation will consist of a permanent ban. The member will be notified by email.

_Note that outcomes for violating the rules will depend on the severity of the offense. It is possible that the first two steps will not take place if the health or safety of a member is or could potentially be at risk._

Repealing of permanent bans will involve the mods discussing the issue between themselves and with anyone who was directly affected by the behavior, as well as a probationary period if the ban is lifted.
