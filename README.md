## Purpose

The Disabled in Tech Slack account exists to create a supportive community of people who work in tech or in adjacent fields who have one or more disabilities. The following rules and Code of Conduct are focused on insuring that our community is a safe, helpful place.

### What is Considered as a Disability for this Slack:

The Disabled in Tech Slack understands that defining what is a disability is a complicated and controversial topic. We therefore are not going to do so. If you feel that you have a disability or that you have had a disability and are still being affected by it, whether it is related to your physical or mental health, you are eligible to join. 

You do not have to be considered disabled by your government, getting any disability assistance, or anything else similar to 'qualify', as how complicated (and expensive) these processes can be vary from country to country and what is or isn't considered a disability by individual countries can also vary.
